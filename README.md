Hello Mr. Smith! Hopefully you are Mr. Smith and not a student from the future who is plagiarizing my work.

My program makes an HTTP Request to a website to retrieve a random Madlib template. It then asks the user a series of questions in an informal manner.

## Example Madlib Produced:

	Alex's Madlib ~ Mon Sep 19 16:29:22 PDT 2022

	History is beautiful because we learn about chair and rocks that happened long ago.
	I can't believe people used to dress in keyboard clothing and kids played with socks and glasses cases instead of video games.
	Also, before cars were invented, people actually rode flamingos! People read sticky notes instead of computers and tablets, and sent messages via lightposts that took 5233 days to arrive.
	I wonder how kids will view my life in 9 year(s); maybe they will ride flying cars to school and play with monitors and boring books.

	This madlib was created by the creative genius, Alex. Props to them for creating this masterpiece although madlibz.herokuapp.com truly did all the dirty work of preparing the Madlib.
